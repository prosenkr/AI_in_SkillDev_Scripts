# AI in Skill Development
Script and data related to the thesis on "AI in Skill Development: An Experimental Study" by Philipp Rosenkranz (2024) at the University of Cologne.\
## How To:
Main analysis in "Analysis.ipynb" can be explored with prepared data files in "data".\
DAT scores were computed in "DAT.ipynb". Note: The pre-computed model file was too big to upload, therefore it has to be computed again if the DAT notebook is used. For analysis, the computed DAT scores in the "dat_scores.csv" can be used.\
